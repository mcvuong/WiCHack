## Challenge

1. Best Hack for Social Good

    In today's society, women and gender minorities are more driven than ever to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. However, we recognize that it takes more than wishful thinking and hard work on behalf of women and gender minorities themselves to propel the demographic forward in these fields; on the one hand, contributing to women’s and gender minorities’ success in their pursuit of STEM training requires initiative from interested, everyday people who would like to reach out. On the other hand, investing in creating a social culture where supporting such innovative and ambitious people is both celebrated and normalized can lead to positively changing cultural attitudes about what ladies can do, how we perceive this demographic, and how we can all participate in lifting them up. We noticed a great opportunity to work with Wegmans, a friendly and family-oriented business, to make supporting women and gender minorities in STEM very easy to achieve. Our application rounds up the total of a customer’s purchase at Wegman’s, and donates the difference to a local organization, such as WIC, that supports women and gender minorities in STEM.
    
## Application Features:

1. Website

    We used **EJS** (Embedded JavaScript templates) for front end, which is a templating language that allows you to generate HTML. EJS was used as a templating engine for **Node.js** for backend, specifically Express. 

    The home page of the webpage is a simple navigation page that allows users to login/signup to an account where they view their transaction history, how much money was donated to a STEM organization of their choice, as well as explore a selection of Women in STEM organizations the customer might consider contributing to.

    Examples of Women in STEM organizations You Can Support
    
        WiCs
        National Girls Collaborative Project
        Women in Engineering Proactive Network
        Million Women Mentors
        American Association of University Women
        Association for Women in Science
        Scientista

2. iOS Mobile App

    We used **Xcode** (an integrated development environment for MacOS) to develop an **iOS** application using **Storyboards** and **Swift**. The application allows users to login/signup to an account where they view their transaction history and how much money was donated to a STEM organization of their choice.
